        Asynchronous programming is a technique that enables your program to start a potentially <br> long-running task and
        still be able to be responsive to other events while that task runs,<br> rather than having to wait until that task
        has finished. Once that task has finished, your program <br> is presented with the result.

    <script>
        setTimeout(myFunction, 3000);

        function myFunction() {
            document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "WPT is awesome";
        }
    </script>
